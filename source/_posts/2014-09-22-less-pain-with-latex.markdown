## Why to use LaTeX. Main alternatives

LaTeX is a document preparation system and document markup language ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)). 
It is widely used within math, physics, computer science, and other fields.
Almost every major conference and journal accepts scientific papers as LaTeX documents
(e.g. [IEEE](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html), [ACM](http://www.acm.org/publications/latex_style/), [IFAC](http://www.ifac-control.org/events/information-for-ifac-authors/latex-style-for-ifac-papers), [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/help/submit)).
Since it was invented many different tools were created to help to create documents using LaTeX.
However, using LaTeX is still hard.
